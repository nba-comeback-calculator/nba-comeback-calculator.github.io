:doc:`Looking to answer a long-held question </analysis/about>`, I downloaded all games
from when play-by-play data was available (from the 1996-1997 season to now) and looked
at the percentage of times games were won under varying conditions.

* :doc:`./analysis/index`: Looks at some trends in the data and tries to answer "Are
  big comebacks just much more common nowadays?" and other questions and a few notes on
  how this project was put together.

* :doc:`./plots/index`: Provides an auto-generated scrollable webpage of many different
  comeback plots (including ones for our Minnesota Timberwolves!).

* :doc:`./calculator/index`: Provides a configurable plotting tool so you can slice and
  dice the data as you like (including for your favorite team).

* :doc:`./analysis/about`: A little bit about this project.

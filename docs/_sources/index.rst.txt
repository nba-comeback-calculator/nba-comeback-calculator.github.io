*What lead is safe and what comeback is possible?*

To examine this question, I downloaded all games from when play by play was available (from the 1996-1997 season
to now) and look at the percent times games were won versus varying conditions.

* :doc:`./analysis/index`:  Looks at some trends in the data and tries to answer the question "are big comebacks just much more common nowadays?"

* :doc:`./methodology/index`: Covers how this data was put together.

* :doc:`./plots/index`: Provides a scrollalbe webpage of many different comeback plots (including ones for our Minnesota Timberwolves!).

* :doc:`./interactive/index`: Provides a configurable plotting tool so you can slice and dice the data as you like (including for you favorite team).

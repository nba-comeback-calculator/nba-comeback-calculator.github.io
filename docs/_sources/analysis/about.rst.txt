This project started when I was :doc:`trying to examine a rule of thumb
</analysis/rule_of_thumb_that_actually_works>` about how safe leads are while watching
NBA games.

While showing a friend some of the data, he suggested that I should try using AI to
code the front end for this project since -- in my day job writing scientific computing
software -- we aren't allowed to use AI on our main codebase, so this was a perfect
opportunity to experiment.

I quickly :doc:`settled on using Claude Code
</analysis/using_claude_code>` and had it build the majority of the JavaScript front
end for this site.

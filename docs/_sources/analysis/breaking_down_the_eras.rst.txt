Breaking Down The Eras 
======================

.. ::

    :ref:`There are many ways to break up the eras <breaking-down-the-eras>`, but
    I've settled on:

    1. Old school era from 1996-2016 versus  
    2. Modern era 2017-2024.

    So, comparing these eras, while the odds of coming back may have increased by
    significant margins, being down 20 points in the modern era starting the 2nd
    half is just about as bad now as it always was.
    
    Overall, I find there's about a 2 point shift -- so 20 is the new 18. What I
    mean by that is the odds of coming back from 20 down is about the same as coming
    back from 18 down when comparing the modern era to the old school one. Notably,
    this two point shift roughly holds across different conditions: for example, for
    the last seven seasons being down 15 points starting the 2nd half has about the
    same win percentage (12.8%) as being down 13 points in the seasons 1996-2016
    before that.

    There is **a lot** of data to look at to come to this conclusion, so I'll try to
    break it down as simply as I can and link when possible to more detailed
    discussions.

    To start, there are several ways people commonly talk about comebacks: being
    down *max N points or more* over some time, being down *exactly* N points over
    some time, or being down *exactly* N points *starting* at some time. Each one
    has a slightly different flavor, so we will look at them all to get a complete
    sense.

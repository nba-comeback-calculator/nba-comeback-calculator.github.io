Do the Timberwolves Actually Give Up Big Leads?
***********************************************

There's a feeling in the zeitgeist that the Timberwolves of the last few years don't
put teams away and frequently give up big leads. I was personally at the `04/21/2022
MEM @ MIN playoff game where the Wolves blew a 26-point lead
<https://www.nba.com/game/0042100153>`_ so I was buying what they were selling.

But when examining the data, it doesn't appear to be true:

    <div id="plots/recent_min_versus/max_down_or_more_48" class="nbacc-chart"></div>

Here, the 'For MIN' are the comeback for the Twolves and the 'For Plays MIN' are the
comebacks we give up compared against all games in the same time range.

Looking at just one point on this chart, if you are down 20 points or more against the
Wolves, your odds of coming back (``4.90%``) are actually worse than the league average
(``5.24%``). And the Timberwolves are actually better than average at coming back from
20 points down (``7.46%``). (Note: this is using the :doc:`trend
lines</analysis/forming_the_plot_trend_lines>` rather than raw data points, which
eliminates much of the statistical noise and is a little more accurate.)

:doc:`There are many ways to analyze this </plots/recent_min_versus>` and they all tell
a slightly different but similar story: the recent Timberwolves are not much different
in giving up big leads than the league average.

But they are *exceptional* that is for sure. For example, check out the the biggest
comebacks ever at 4 minutes remaining from when play by play was recorded:

.. raw:: html

    <div id="twolves_leads/at_4min_all_time" class="nbacc-chart"></div>

The record is a -17 point comeback given up by our 2020 Twolves.  But to bolster what I
said before, if you look at the next dot over at -16, it's the Twolves who came back
against OKC on 2/24/2025.  Not to mention the recent comeback from -13 down with 4
minutes left against Houston on 12/27/2024 (hover over the dots to get the game details
and links to nba.com).  So once again the recent Twolves come back more than they let
the lead slip away.

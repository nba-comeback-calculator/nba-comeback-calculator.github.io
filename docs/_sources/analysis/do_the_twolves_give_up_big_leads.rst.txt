Do the Timberwolves Actually Give Up Big Leads?
***********************************************

There's a feeling in the zeitgeist that the Timberwolves of the last few years don't
put teams away and frequently give up big leads. I was personally at the `04/21/2022 MEM @ MIN
playoff game where the Wolves blew a 26-point lead
<https://www.nba.com/game/0042100153>`_ so I was buying what they were selling.

But when examining the data, it doesn't appear to be true:

    <div id="plots/recent_min_versus/max_down_or_more_48" class="nbacc-chart"></div>

In fact, if you are down 20 points or more against the Wolves, your odds of coming back
(``4.90%``) are actually worse than the league average (``5.24%``). And the
Timberwolves are actually better than average at coming back from 20 points down
(``7.46%``). (Note: this is using the :doc:`trend
lines</analysis/forming_the_plot_trend_lines>` rather than raw data points, which
eliminates much of the statistical noise and is a little more accurate.)

:doc:`There are many ways to analyze this </plots/recent_min_versus>` and they all tell
a slightly different but similar story: the recent Timberwolves are not much different
in giving up big leads than the league average.

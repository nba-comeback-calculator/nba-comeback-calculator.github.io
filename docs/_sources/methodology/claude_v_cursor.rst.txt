⏺ I've implemented the NBA Charts Calculator feature as requested. Here's what I've
added:

  1. Created three new files:
    - bacc_calculator_core.js - Core functionality with Num class for math
      operations and data processing
    - js/nbacc_calculator_ui.js - UI handling for the calculator lightbox
    - css/nbacc-calculator.css - Styling for the calculator UI
  2. Updated test_calculator.html with:
    - Added Bootstrap CSS and JS for better UI components
    - Added Math.js library for mathematical operations
    - Included our new calculator JavaScript and CSS files
  3. Key features implemented:
    - Press 'c' key to open calculator UI in a lightbox
    - Select from 4 plot types: "Max Points Down Or More", "Max Points Down", "Points Down At Time", "Percent Chance: Time
  Vs. Points Down"
    - Add multiple year ranges (1996-2024) with options for regular season and playoffs
    - Add multiple game filters with team selection and ranking filters
    - Interactive UI with Bootstrap styling

  The calculator will load season data from JSON files, process it according to
  selected filters, and then use the existing chart library to display the results.

Prompt: When the light box opens, the form is too high.  1. Create some white space
around at the top and bottom.  Also use more width if you can.
  Overall, the options need to be way tighter for what we are selecting.  Also, the
  remove button needs to be not red.

.. code::   > The the title for Year Groups should be Seasons.   There should not be a label 
    box.   The Regular Season and Playoff should both be checked by       │
   default.  When both are selected, the year_groups passed to the javascript should
   be [["{min_year}", "{max_year}"]].  When only regular season is    │ │   selected
   it should be [["R{min_year}", "{max_year}"]] when only playoffs is selected it
   should be [["P{min_year}", "{max_year}"]].  The 'Remove'     │ │   Button should
   only be on the 2nd or 3rd or 4th etc year groups.  We must have 1 year group.
   Also, the remove button needs to be further to the      │ │   right.

    Let's try this python to javascript translation again.

    Currently, we have working the js/nbacc_chart_loader.js and js/nbacc_plotter_*.js
    files code that can load the json data from _static/json/charts/* and plot the
    charts.

    Now we need to add a new 'calculator' feature that will provide a UI to select plot
    options.  You have added the start of this boostrap UI in the
    js/nbacc_calculator_ui.js file. and it is a good start.

    Now we need to add the core logic that will process this form, create the json data
    and then feed this json data to the chart loader and plotter (instead of reading the
    json data from the _static/json/charts/* directory).

    The core python files that need to be translated are located at
    ../../../nba_python_data/form_plots/form_nba_chart_json_data/

    We need to translate each file here to javascript and be named
    form_nba_chart_json_data_api.py -> js/nbacc_calculator_api.js
    form_nba_chart_json_data_num.py -> js/nbacc_calculator_num.js

    etc.

    The form_nba_chart_json_data_num.py uses scipy and numpy and we will need to use
    Math.js and replicate all the functionality of this python file.  You already tried
    once at ../../../nba_python_data/old/js/nbacc_calculator_core.js -- you can use this
    file as a reference.

    However, this time we need to translate all of the logic found in the four python
    files in   ../../../nba_python_data/form_plots/form_nba_chart_json_data/

    The key classes / functions to translate are:
    
    plot_biggest_down_or_more plot_percent_chance_time_vs_points_down GameFilter


    The UI will pass the selected options to these functions.  You can look at
    ../../../nba_python_data/form_plots/form_nba_json_data_for_sphinx_pages to see how
    this is called.

    Basically, from the UI when a Plot Type of "Max Down Or More is selected, we call
    the plot_biggest_down_or_more function with the selected options like this:
    
      def plot_biggest_deficit(
        year_groups,  # This is from the Seasons form field 
        start_time,  # This is from the Time form field 
        stop_time=0, # This is zero for all Max Down Or More 
        cumulate=True, 
        game_filters=None,  # This is from the Game Filters form field
    ):

    When a Plot Type of "Max Down" is selected, we call the plot_biggest_down_or_more
    function with the selected options like this:
    
      def plot_biggest_deficit(
        year_groups,  # This is from the Seasons form field 
        start_time,  # This is from the Time form field 
        stop_time=0, # This is zero for all Max Down Or More 
        cumulate=False,  # This is False for Max Down, True for Max Down Or More
        game_filters=None,  # This is from the Game Filters form field
    ):

    When a Plot Type of "Points Down At Time" is selected, we call the
    plot_biggest_down_or_more function with the selected options like this:
    
      def plot_biggest_deficit(
        year_groups,  # This is from the Seasons form field 
        start_time,  # This is from the Time form field 
        stop_time=None, # This None for Points Down at Time 
        cumulate=False,  # This is False for Max Down, True for Max Down Or More
        game_filters=None,  # This is from the Game Filters form field
    ):

    For the "Percent Chance: Time Vs. Points Down" plot type, we call the
    plot_percent_chance_time_vs_points_down function with the selected options like this:
    
      def plot_percent_chance_time_vs_points_down(
        year_groups,  # This is from the Seasons form field
        start_time,  # This is from the Time form field
        stop_time=0, # This None for Points Down at Time
        percents=percents # This is from Percents field, a UI element we still need to add.
      )
.. code::
    We need to try again on writing the calculator core logic that will accept the UI
    form and plot a chart.  Please:
      1. Re-read the CALCULATOR.md and the Section ## 3/23 Python to Javascript Translation                                                                
      2. Re-write the CALCULATOR.md to reflect this change and get rid of the ## 3/23 Python to Javascript Translation section once you have incorporated all of it's logic.
      3. Do what it is asking you to do: translate the 4 python files to javascript, connect the calculator ui to this calculator logic and then call our plotting libraries to actually plot the chart.js plot.
   
.. code::

    We want an *exact* translation of the python files in ../../../nba_python_data/form_plots/form_nba_chart_json_data/.  Re-read them and check that
    your implementation works exactly like those files.  We don't need to do any checking for default or unneceesary error checking.  The goal here is
    a 1 to 1 translation.

.. code::

    Your starting implementation of js/nbacc_calculator_season_game_loader.js is good.  However, we want a 1 to 1 direct translation of
    ../../../nba_python_data/form_plots/form_nba_chart_json_data/form_nba_chart_json_data_season_game_loader.py.  Ensure that your translation is 1 to
    1 and do not add any additional error checking or setting default.  Update the CLAUDE.md to note we don't want to add unncessary error checking and
      efault settings.  The code is correct by construction and we will ensure the UI forms will only provide valid values.

.. code::

     > First, rename js/nbacc_calculator_core.js to js/nbacc_calculator_plot_primitives.js and make sure it matches                                         │
    form_nba_chart_json_data_plot_primitives.py 1 to 1 without any unnecessary error checking.  Then, do the same for js/nbacc_calculator_api.js and     │
    make sure it matches the form_nba_chart_json_data_api.py api.  Again we are trying to match the exact logic of the python files, just making it      │
    work in javascript for our webpage.      

.. code::

    > Then, do the same for js/nbacc_calculator_api.js and make sure it matches the
    form_nba_chart_json_data_api.py api.  Again we are trying to match the exact logic
    of the python files, just making it work in javascript for our webpage.  Remember,
    this file is what the bootstrap UI will call when we hit calculate and call either
    the plot_biggest_deficit or plot_percent_versus_time.  Note, we do not need the
    json_name field because, inlike the python, we are not storing json data.  Note this
    key difference in the CALCULATOR.md file and update the CLAUDE.md file to reference
    the
    CALCULATOR.md file.  In the CALCULATOR.md file, note that we are not storing json
    data to disk like the python version, but rather we are creating json data in
    memory which we will pass to our plotting*.js files which will plot the data in
    chart.js.  Then, make sure the calculator ui js file
    is correctly calling into the calculator api.py script and that the created json is
    then correctly being passed to our plotting js files.

Many! of these:

    > Now when pressing 'Calculate', we get this error:
    nbacc_calculator_ui.js:596 Error calculating chart: ReferenceError: addDatasetsToChart is not defined
    at Object.formatDataForChartJS (nbacc_plotter_data.js:594:9)
    at calculateAndRenderChart (nbacc_calculator_ui.js:593:52)

.. code::

    The const model_probit = Num.fit_it_mle(X, Y, "probit", this.m, this.b); is not
    return the correct values, they are wildly off. Can you look at the python
    json_data_num.py implementation.  I think something is wrong with our minimize
    function.  Include the numeric.js cdn and use the minimize function in that
    library. Add the cdn to the test_calculator.html page.  Do not delete your
    original minimize function, comment it out and use a new method.

.. code::
    When we click on the "Percent Chance: Time Vs. Points Down" . 1. The default value should be 24 for time.  Also, to the right of the "time" field    │
    there needs to be a 'percent' field.  This should be a drop down chooser with the values '33%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, Record, Guides, Calculated          │
    Guides."  The 20% 10% 5% 1% Record should be chosen by default.  These options will be passed to the plot_percent_v_time function in the API.  The   │
    percents will be passed to the percents arguement.  If "Guides" are picked, plot_2x_guide, plot_4x_guide and plot_6x_guide will be set to True.  If  │
    Calculated Guides is Checked, plot_calculated_guides is checked.  At least 1 option must be checked.

    ⏺ Great! I've implemented all the requested changes:

     1. Added a "Percent" dropdown field that appears when the "Percent Chance: Time Vs. Points Down" plot type is selected
     2. Set the default time value to 24 minutes for this plot type
     3. Created options in the percent dropdown: "33%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%", "20%, 10%, 5%, 1%", "10%, 5%, 1%", "5%, 1%", "1%", "Record", "Guides", and
     "Calculated Guides"
     4. Made "20%, 10%, 5%, 1%" the default option
     5. Modified the plot_percent_v_time function call to use the selected options:
       - When regular percentages are selected, they're passed as the percentages argument
       - When "Guides" is selected, plot_2x_guide, plot_4x_guide, and plot_6x_guide are set to true
       - When "Calculated Guides" is selected, plot_calculated_guides is set to true

     These changes will make the calculator more flexible by allowing users to customize which win probability percentages they want to visualize in the
      chart, as well as providing options for different guide line styles.

    No, we want the 'Percent' Field to be a multi select.  Every option should be a single option "33%" is one option.  "25%" is one option.  "Record"   │
    is one option, etc.  "Guides" is one option.  "Calculated Guides" is one option.  Users can select 1 or more (or even all) the options.  By          │
    default, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, and Record should be selected.  At least 1 options needs to be selected (we can't have no options selcted).  Please use   │
    a bootstrap Multi Select box to accomplish this. Also, the Percent box should be to the right of the Time box in the widget layout.

  
.. code::
    What kind of UI element did you use for the time field -- what type is that called
    in the bootstrap UI terminology?

    For the time field, I used a standard Bootstrap dropdown/select element. In
    Bootstrap terminology, this is called a "form select" or simply a "select input".
    It's a single-select dropdown menu created using the HTML <select> element with the
    Bootstrap class form-control.

    This is different from the multi-select we implemented for the percent field, which
    allows multiple selections and uses the enhanced Bootstrap-select plugin for better
    usability.

    The time field doesn't have any special Bootstrap component applied to it - it's
    just a basic dropdown select with Bootstrap's standard styling.

.. code::

      Can you use that same style with for the Percent field but make the options be check boxes?  I want the same style as the Time field, just with a
      check box interface where we can select multiple items, with the default being 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, Record.  This post is doing something similar 63
